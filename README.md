#### Data Structures Exercises

<em> To help me better understand data structures, I've build a few from scratch from given exercise prompts from [@mosh-hamedani](https://github.com/mosh-hamedani)'s
Ultimate Data Structures and Algorithms course where he goes over data structures' behaviors and then tells us to build the
data structure from scratch, along with method doc strings for us to create methods from.</em>
